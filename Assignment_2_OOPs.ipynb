Inheritance is significant in OOP because it promotes code reusability, modularity, and the creation of a hierarchy of classes that represent objects with varying degrees of specialization. It simplifies the development of complex applications by allowing you to build upon existing classes, thereby reducing redundancy and making code more maintainable."
